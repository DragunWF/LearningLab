# Insertion Sort

- Builds up the sort gradually creating a larger left half which is always sorted.

## Pseudocode

- Start by picking the second element in the array
- Now compare the second element with the one before it and swap if necessary
- Continue to the next element and if it is in the incorrect order, iterate through the sorted portion (i.e. the left side) to place the element in the correct place.
- Repeat until the array is sorted

## Implementation

```js
function insertionSort(arr) {
  let currentVal;
  for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
    currentVal = arr[i];
    for (let j = i - 1; j >= 0 && arr[j] > currentVal; j--) {
      arr[j + 1] = arr[j];
    }
    arr[j + 1] = currentVal;
  }
  return arr;
}

insertionSort([2, 1, 9, 76, 4]);
```
