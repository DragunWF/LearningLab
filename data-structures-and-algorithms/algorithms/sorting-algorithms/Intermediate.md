# Intermediate Sorting Algorithms

## General

### Objectives

- Understand the limtations of the sorting algorithms we've learned so far.
- Implement merge sort
- Implement quick sort
- Implement radix sort

### Why learn this?

- The sorting algorithms we've learned so far don't scale well.
- Trying out bubble sort on an array of 100000 elements, it will take quite some time!

### Faster Sorts

- There is a family of sorting algorithms that can improve time complexity from `O(n^2)` to `O(n log n)`
- There's a tradeoff between efficiency and simplicity
- The more efficient algorithms are much less simple, and genrally take longer to understand
