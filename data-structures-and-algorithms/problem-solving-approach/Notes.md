# Problem Solving Approach

## Objectives

- Define what an algorithm is
- Devise a plan to solve algorithms
- Compare and contrast problem solving patterns including frequency counters, two pointer problems and divide and conquer.

## Miscellaneous

### How do you improve?

1. **Devise** a plan for solving problems.
2. **Master** common problem solving patterns.

### Other

- Using boolean conditionals on character codes are a lot faster than using regex.

### Problem Solving Strategies

#### 1. Understand the Problem

- Can I restate the problem in my own words?
- What are the inputs that go into the problem?
- What are the ouputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
- Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem? (You may not be able to answer this question until you set about solving the problem. That's okay; it's still worth considering the question at this early stage.)
- How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?

#### 2. Explore Concrete Examples

- Coming up with examples can help you understand the problem better
- Examples also provide sanity checks that your eventual solution works how it should
- Unit Tests
- Start with simple examples then progress to more complex examples.
- Explore examples with empty inputs
- Explore examples with invalid inputs

#### 3. Break It Down

- Explicitly write out the steps you need to take
- This forces you to think about the code you'll write before you write it, and helps you catch any lingering conceptual issues or misunderstandings before you dive in and have to worry about details (e.g. language syntax) as well.
- While it may not be needed for simpler problems, for complex problems it can be a life saver.

#### 4. Solve/Simplify

- Solve the problem, if you can't solve a simpler problem; a smaller part of the problem that overall contributes to the entire solution.
- Solve an easier part of the problem to simplify.
- In other words, find the core difficulty in what you're trying to do.
- Temporarily ignore that difficulty
- Write a simplified solution
- Then incorporate that difficulty back in

#### 5. Look Back and Refactor

- Can you check the result?
- Can you derive the result differently?
- Can you understand it at a glance?
- Can you use the result or method for some other problem?
- Can you improve the performance of your solution?
- Can you think of other ways to refactor?
- How have other people solved this problem?
