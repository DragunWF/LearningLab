// Write a function which takes two numbers and returns their sum.

function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

console.log(sum(3, 5));

// 1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
("We just make a function that adds two numbers together");

// 2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
// - ints?
// - floats?
// - what about string for large numbers?

// 3. What are the ouputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
// - int? float? string?

// 4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem? (You may not be able to answer this question until you set about solving the problem. That's okay; it's still worth considering the question at this early stage.)

// 5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?
