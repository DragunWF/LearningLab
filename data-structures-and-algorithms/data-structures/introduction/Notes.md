# Introduction To Data Structures

## General

### What do they do?

- Data structures are collections of values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.
- There is no **BEST** data structure. They all excel in different situations.

### Why are there so many?

- Different data structures excel at different things. Some are highly specialized, while others (like arrays) are more generally used.

### Why should you care?

- The more time you spend as a developer, the more likely you'll need to use one of these data structures.
- You've already worked with many of them unknowningly! _Examples: DOM (Tree), etc._
- For interviews...

### Examples of data structures excelling in different situations

- If you're working with map/location data. Use a **graph**.
- Need an ordered list with fast inserts/removals at the beginning and end? Use a **linked list**.
- Web scraping nested HTML? Use a **tree**.
- Need to write a scheduler? Use a **binary heap**.
